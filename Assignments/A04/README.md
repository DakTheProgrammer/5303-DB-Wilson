# What is this project:
  - This project uses the tables that can be found on http://sqlzoo.net and the different questions associated with them. With this I have published my answers(queries) in a FastAPI API that can be found hosted at the link and port above.

# Why is this project important:
  - This project is important in that it:
      - Taught me SQL and the basic level of querries that are associated with it
      - Helped me start figuring out how to problem solve on a database
      - Introduced me to API's and how they worked
      - Introduced me to ports and linux server enviorments
      - Introduced me to PHPMyAdmin and graphical database tools
      - Helped me learn from scratch how to create databases and the tools that come with them
      - Taught me how websites are hosted and the basics around them

# Where did I struggle doing this project:
  - I struggled with the completly new concepts that come along with taking a class like this that has a massive learing curve for new topics
  - I struggled heavily at the beginning learing a new language ontop of new libraries
  - I struggled with the concepts that surround databases since all I have really done prior was serial coding
  - I struggled with the amount of work that projects like this take but still managed to overcome them and get this done on time
  - I struggled with the complexities behind making API's and testing that has to be done since it isnt all in the console like normal programming 

# What issues did I enconter:
  - Some issues that I encountered were: 
    - Bad API design
    - Issues with making sure everything in MySQL were running properly
    - Using Postman to test post routes and how to make sure that they are working properly
    - The new datatypes that come with FastAPI and how all of them work
    - Conecting with MySQL in python and allowing the API to have admin privlages

# What I did to combat these issues:
  The biggest thing that I did to combat all of these issues was to just read documentation and understand all of the errors that I was getting. I also spent alot of time reading on the design and how you should write API's. Lastly, I also had to do a lot of trial an error just to learn what is the correct way of doing things and how I can improve on this work in the future

# How was this project relevant to the real world:
  - This project is relevent to the real world in that most of the querries and tables that are asked on SQLzoo are questions that are likely to be asked at interviews and will most likely be used to help me understand the basic concepts of SQL in my future endevors.
  - It is also relevant in that it has taught me how databases function as well as how you can use that information to make a product that the whole world can see using just a simple url search.
  - Also it is relevant because many development teams use a server to share information and a work space to make a project.
