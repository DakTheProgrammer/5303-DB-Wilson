# What is this project:
  - This project is a way to gauge what database languages are better then others at specific tasks. Specifically with this one we used JSON data to load into SQL, MongoDB, and Redis. This project showed me a lot in how these langauges do all of the diffrent functionality. It also really opened my eyes on Redis and how it was used and what it is good for and also waht it isn't good at.

# Why is this project important:
  - This project is important in that it:
      - Gave me an introduction to Reids
      - Showed off to me what Databases are better for loading JSON data
      - Gave me an introduction to how these DB's need to constantly evolve around newer technologies
      - Showed me that SQL isn't always the best DB to use due to it being the only one I really knew when I went into this class
      - Shows a good experiment in the timing of querries
      - Gave me a base level of being able to choose which DB to use in which situations
      - Was the first time I truely compared DB's versus when I would just choose what I was confortable with

# Where did I struggle doing this project:
  - Understanding how hashing worked in Reids
  - Realizing how diffrent each languages does all of the diffrent querries
  - Understanding how to properly search for many things in Redis
  - Dealing with Excel's graph maker
  - Working with and setting up a brand new Database on my server

# What issues did I enconter:
  - Some issues that I encountered were: 
    - Redis doesn't have a well placed multisearch for hashing
    - Mongo's format for updating rows
    - SQL having to do many things one row at a time
    - Installing Redis on my server
    - Using Redis Python in that it returned everything in byte format

# What I did to combat these issues:
  The biggest thing that I did to combat all of these issues was to read many diffrent wesites especially mongo'ss and redis's designated websites. I also had to do alot of trial and error on my server testing with the CLI's for all of the langugaes. I also did lots of discussion with other classmates in finding what others were doing to overcome there issues. 

# How was this project relevant to the real world:
  - Uses diffrent DB's and times them to find the best soultion for a problem
  - Works with JSON in that it has become somewhat of a standard due to it's hashing style
  - Gives a new perspective on that there can be many different DB languages to solve a single problem
